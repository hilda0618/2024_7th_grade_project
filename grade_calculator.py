#B+ = 87-89, B = 83-86, B- = 80-82
#C+ = 77-79, C = 73-76, C- = 70-72
#D = 60-69, F = 0-59
#Make sure the user can input decimals too, round the numbers
#Hint: Use the float() function to convert the user's input to a float
#Hint: Use the round() function to round the user's input to the nearest hundredth
